Library Lite is a robust full stack web application designed to streamline library operations by providing digital solutions for managing books, authors, copies, loans, returns, and reporting. By automating repetitive tasks and improving data accessibility, Library Lite addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of traditional, manual library management.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗟𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝘀 👇👇

•⁠  ⁠Tracking books, copies, authors, and users by hand leads to errors, confusion, and wasted time.

•⁠  ⁠Without a digital system, books often go missing, returns get delayed, and vital statistics like “most borrowed book” are impossible to know.

•⁠  ⁠Libraries need a one-stop platform to automate inventory, loans, and reporting for smoother, smarter operations.
