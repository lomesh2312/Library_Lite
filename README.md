Library Lite is a robust full stack web application designed to streamline library operations by providing digital solutions for managing books, authors, copies, loans, returns, and reporting. By automating repetitive tasks and improving data accessibility, Library Lite addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of traditional, manual library management.

🚩 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗟𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝘀 👇👇

•⁠  ⁠Without a digital system, books often go missing, returns get delayed, and vital statistics like “most borrowed book” are impossible to know.

•⁠  ⁠Libraries need a one-stop platform to automate inventory, loans, and reporting for smoother, smarter operations. 

💡 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐋𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐋𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐱𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 👇👇

•⁠  ⁠Generates powerful daily/weekly/monthly reports, showing what’s working and what needs attention.

•⁠  ⁠Ensures late fees and penalties are managed automatically, so nothing slips through the cracks.

•⁠  ⁠Lets users and staff find any book instantly with a search bar that works by title, author, genre, or availability.
